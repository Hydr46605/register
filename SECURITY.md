# Terms of Service  
[![Banner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creepersbs/.github/refs/heads/main/profile/mini-banner.png)](https://creepers.sbs)
## Contract  
By using my service, you allow me (CreeperHUB/Giocoliere) to manually remove your website/server/subdomain in the event of a breach of the Code of Conduct, and to verify your use of our service. I will check your service/website/etc. whenever I choose to do so. If you are banned and believe it to be a false ban, please contact me at [`support@creepercraft.store`](mailto:support@creepercraft.store)/[`DISCORD (faster)`](https://giocoliere.dev/discord).  
By using this service, you also agree that we will not use the following list of domains if under the main creepers.sbs root:  
1 - `any country/continent code`, such as **`en.creepers.sbs`**, **`eu.creepers.sbs`** `or others like that`, (you are allowed to use any subdomains of country codes only like this: `smth.en.creepers.sbs`)  
2 - `shop, store, or ecommerce` domains that may be misunderstood as official creepers.sbs shops  
3 - `mc or play` domains, as we do not have an official Minecraft server: you can still use `mc/play.yourservername.creepers.sbs`  
4 - `about, translate, status, whois, and any other official subdomain...` since those domains are planned for use by creepers.sbs's own project  
5 - `all the domains listed in the reserved folder`, this one - > [**`folder link`**](https://github.com/creepersbs/register/tree/main/domains/reserved)  
6 - `any social name`, as our official socials cannot be misunderstood by any subdomain you might register  

### Responsibility  
You acknowledge that **you are solely responsible for any actions taken with your subdomain**. I accept **no responsibility** for what users do with **their** subdomain or any consequences that arise from its use.  

### Checks  
I am required to periodically check the usage of my services. This means I will need to verify the use of the `subdomain` (by visiting the relevant page on a website) or a `Minecraft server` (by joining the server; if there is a whitelist, you should add me with the username: "**`Giocoliere`**").  

### Removal  
If **any `verified` business** requests us `via email`, `Issue request`, or `DM` to remove a subdomain you created that violates their TOS, I will **remove** the domain.  
However, as I stated, the employee/company **must `prove their identity` beforehand**.  

### Max Usage  
Currently, any user (besides the team) can register up to **`3 domains`** in **total**, counting both the **.sbs** and **.cloud** requests.  
[_This number could increase; only time will tell_]  

### Service Usage  
- The domain is `reserved for life` by a single user unless they wish to [`transfer it to another user or a GitHub organization`](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/transferring-a-repository) through an [**`email`**](mailto:support@creepercraft.store) or a [**`request on Discord`**](https://creepers.sbs/discord) (only if you have included the username in the [`subdomain registration file`](https://github.com/creepersbs/register/blob/main/domains/template.json) and you joined the [**`Discord Server`**](https://creepers.sbs/discord); any username changes **`should be communicated with an update to the file`**).  
- If a domain is **banned**, it will be placed in a folder called [**"blacklisted"**](https://github.com/creepersbs/register/tree/main/domains/blacklisted) and cannot be used by other users to avoid reputational repercussions.  
- The domain **can remain connected even if not used**; however, the eventual **deletion of the GitHub account**, **deletion of the copied repository**, or the **input of false or invalid data** (e.g., `temporary email`, `temporary GitHub account`...) will void the domain request, triggering the following penalty: **`deletion of the domain and placement on the blacklist`**.  

### Enforcement of Rules  
These rules will be enforced only for those who start using the service from **July 1, 2025**. Users who have deleted the repository/account or used fake accounts/emails will not face any penalties as of now.  

## Reporting a Vulnerability  
You can report low-severity bugs as issues [**`here`**](https://github.com/creepersbs/register/issues/new) or by contacting [**`@me`**](https://github.com/giocoliere) via [**`Discord`**](https://giocoliere.dev/discord). However, for higher-severity vulnerabilities, bugs, or Contact Violations, please email [**`support@creepercraft.store`**](mailto:support@creepercraft.store) and I will try to resolve the issue as quickly as possible.
