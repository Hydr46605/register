# Terms of the service

## Contract
By using my service you allow me (CreeperHUB/Giocoliere) to manually remove your website/server/subdomain at the eventuality of a Code Of Conduct breach, and to check that you wont use our service I will check on your service/website/etc.. every time i want to do it. If you get banned and think its a false ban please contact me at [`support@creepercraft.store`](mailto:suppport@creepercraft.store)/[`DISCORD (faster)`](https://giocoliere.dev/discord)

By using this service you allow us also to not use this list of domains if under the main creepers.sbs root: <br>
1 -`every country/continent code`, such as **`en.creepers.sbs`**, **`eu.creepers.sbs`** `or others like that`, (you are able to use any subdomains of country codes only like this: `smth.en.creepers.sbs`) <br>
2 - `shop, store or ecommerce` domains that can be missunderstood for official creepers.sbs subdomains <br>
3 - `mc or play` domains, we dont have an official minecraft server: you still can take `mc/play.youservername.creepers.sbs` <br>
4 - `about, translate, status, whois, and any other official subdomain...` since those are domains planned to be used by creepers.sbs own project <br>
5 - `all the domains listed in the reserved folder`, this one - > [**`folder link`**](https://github.com/creepersbs/register/tree/main/domains/reserved) <br>
6 - `any social name`, our official socials can't be missunderstood by any subdomain you might register
